    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A smooth and creamy sauce that brings a good breakfast together.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>half a lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a saucepan and a heatproof mixing bowl that will sit stably over the pan. Half-fill the pan with water and bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat as low as it can go but still have the water simmering.
        </li>
        <li>Place the butter in a medium pan over a low heat, so it starts to melt but doesn’t burn. When the butter has melted, take it off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks in your heatproof mixing bowl, which you should then place over the pan of just-simmering water. It’s important that the saucepan is on a low heat, or the eggs will scramble.</li>
        <li>Using a balloon whisk, start to beat your eggs, then whisk in your white wine vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>Keep whisking, and then start adding the melted butter by slowly drizzling it in, whisking all the time, till all the butter has been incorporated. The result should be a lovely, smooth, thick sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Season carefully with sea salt and black pepper, and loosen if necessary with little squeezes of lemon juice. Keep tasting the sauce until the flavour is to your liking.
        </li>
    </ol>
