    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 rooughy chopped onions</li>
        <li>250g roughly chopped celery</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 sliced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon allspice</li>
        <li>1/2 a tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons celery salt</li>
        <li>2kg roughly chopped ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons taomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 a teaspoon Tobasco sauce</li>
        <li>200ml white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>200g golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the onions and celery into a food processor and whizz until finely chopped. Heat the oil in a very large saucepan, add the onions and celery, cover, then soften over a low heat for 5 mins. Add the garlic, cook 5 mins more, then tip in the spices and cook for 1 min.</li>
        <li>Now stir in all remaining ingredients and bring to the boil. Keep on a bubbling simmer, uncovered, for 1 hr until the tomatoes are squashy and the liquid has reduced by several inches. Discard the cinnamon stick.</li>
        <li>Whizz the mix with a stick blender until smooth, then sieve into a bowl. The ketchup will thicken a little when it cools, but if yours seems very runny (this will depend on the juiciness of your tomatoes), put it back on the heat and cook a little longer, stirring often, until reduced. Keep the ketchup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 months, or freeze in batches. If you like, keep in sterilised bottles or jars for up to 6 months - see tip, below.</li>
    </ol>
